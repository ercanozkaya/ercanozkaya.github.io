      <description>I am a software engineer based in Istanbul, Turkey.
My main focus is crafting products with a robust architecture that provide a natural user experience.
I am passionate about free software and have worked on various open source projects throughout my career. Most notable is the Joomla project where I took the role of release manager and also participated in the Google Summer of Code program.
Right now I work as a consultant for Timble where I lead the Joomlatools brand and build things for the web.</description>
